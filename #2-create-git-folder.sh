# Creating Git Folder
# Now, let's create a new folder for our project

$mkdir githubtutorial
$cd githubtutorial

# mkdir:- makes a new directory
# cd:- changes the current working directory.

# Now that we are in the correct directory. We can start by initializing Git!

# Note: If you already have a folder/directory you would like to use for Git
# Navigate to it in command line, or open it in your file explorer, right-click and select "Git Bash here"s
