# Initialize Git
# Once you have navigated to the correct folder, you can initialize Git on that folder

$git init
# o/p:- Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/myproject/.git/

# You just created your first Git Repository!

# Note: Git now knows that it should watch the folder you initiated it on.
# Git creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes.
