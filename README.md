## What is Git
    Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps developers manage changes to source code over time. Git is widely used in software development for its speed, efficiency, and ability to handle projects of all sizes.

### Key Features of Git

    Distributed System:- Every user has a complete copy of the entire repository, including the full history, which allows for offline work and improved redundancy.

    Branching and Merging:- Git makes it easy to create and manage branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments. Merging branches is typically fast and efficient, enabling parallel development.

    Commit History:- Git tracks changes as commits, each with a unique identifier, allowing developers to review and revert to previous states.

    Staging Area:- Git includes a staging area (index) where changes can be reviewed and modified before committing to the repository.

    Distributed Workflow:- Multiple users can work independently on their own branches and merge changes into a shared repository, facilitating collaborative development.

    Integrity:- Every file and commit in Git is checksummed using SHA-1 hash, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the data.

### Benefits of Using Git

    Collaboration: Facilitates teamwork by enabling multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
    
    Backup and Restore: Acts as a backup system where every version of the project is saved, making it easy to revert to previous states if needed.
    
    Code Integrity: Ensures that code changes are tracked, and any issues introduced can be traced back to their source.

    Efficient Workflows: Supports various workflows, including feature branching, continuous integration, and more.
