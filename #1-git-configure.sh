# Configure Git
# Now let Git know who you are. This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information

$git config --global user.name "Tanish Anand"
$git config --global user.email "xyz@gmail.com"


# Note: Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.
# If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global.
